                    development process is no exception here. If you follow the well-tested software development
                    processes,
                    you are sure to build amazing software. According to a survey by GoodFirms, adapting to the changing
                    client requirements is the most challenging part of the development process for software developers.

                    Being a leading software development company, we decided to solve these issues once and for all. In
                    this

                <h1>What is SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)?</h1><br>

                <h6>In order to understand SDLC, let’s first understand what What is<br> software development process.
                    In
                    simple words, the software development process is dividing the software<br> development into tiny,
                    sequential steps to enhance the product, project, and design altogether.<br> the iterative logical
                    process for software program development or application development to <br>cater to the needs of any
                    business or personal objectives is known as ‘Software Development’.

                    We know that software developers use app development software to create a<br> specific code for any
                    software development or application development. However, coding is only<br> a part of a big process
                    called the software development process or life cycle. The entire software<br> development cycle
                    consists of ideation, research, coding, documenting, testing, debugging,<br> deployment, and
                    updating,
                    used by the software industry.

                    The software industry uses SDLC as it helps to produce high-quality <br>software to meet customer
                    expectations and perform rapid application development to complete<br> within the given time and
                    cost
                    estimates.

                    Now that you have understood the definition of SDLC, it is now time<br> to understand the 6 stages
                    of
                    the software development process.</h6>

                                <h3><b>1. Requirements Analysis and Resource Planning</b></h3>

                                The first step to any process is always planning. Being a project manager, you might
                                have done a requirement analysis of your project, but you are going to need software
                                engineering experts to create a software development plan for your project.

                                You need to analyze if the software, you are planning to develop, aligns with your
                                business or personal goals. This is a requirements analysis. The purpose of any software
                                is to make the tasks easier. So, you must check which tasks you are trying to optimize
                                and how the software will help you in this.

                                After this, you need to allocate resources for software development process. You need to
                                decide what kind of resources you will need in order to complete it. You can plan the
                                number of project managers, software engineers, designers, tools, and technologies
                                required for the project. Then, you need to create a flexible yet justifiable
                                budget.<br><br>


                                <h3><b>2. Design and Prototyping</b></h3>

                                After the analysis and planning part is over, it is time to start creating a software
                                architecture for the product. This architecture or design will define the complete
                                workflow of the software. In terms of software, the design doesn’t only have to do about
                                the look but also about the overall functioning and user experience of the software.

                                You can play an important part in the design process as you need to explain to the
                                software designers what is that you want from the program. You can define how the users
                                will interact with the software application/product. The designers will design simple
                                wireframes to show these interactions using various tools like Adobe and InVision. If
                                needed, you can also have complete prototypes that display each and every functionality
                                of the product.

                                In this stage, you can check if there are any drawbacks or lack of any features. You can
                                easily make changes in this stage and start with development when everything is
                                finalized.<br><br>



                                <h3><b>3. Software Development</b></h3>

                                Development in software-process only begins when you are completely sure of the
                                requirements and onboard with the design and features. The development team starts
                                working on the development of a program by writing the necessary code.

                                Now, the development is carried out in different manners based on the type of software
                                requirements. You will understand it in the software development life cycles models
                                section below.

                                This is the riskiest phase of the software development process. However, being an
                                experienced software development company, we easily understand the requirements and
                                develop a product up to the expectations.<br><br>


                                <h3> <b>4. Testing</b></h3>

                                This is actually a continuous process of software development, and testing is performed
                                alongside development. Testing is done to check the functionality, usability, and
                                stability of the product under the rapid development process.

                                We have a team of quality assurance testers or QA testers. This team tests every piece
                                of code created by the software development team. This is done both manually as well
                                with automated tools to find out if there are any bugs or glitches.

                                Later, bugs are fixed by changing or adding new code to the original code. We make sure
                                that your final product runs smoothly on the preferred devices and has all the required
                                features and functionalities as discussed.<br><br>


                                <h3> <b>5. Deployment</b></h3>

                                This is a crucial stage in the software development life cycle. After coding and testing
                                are done, the next development phase is to deploy your software on the necessary servers
                                and devices. This is only done after you have approved of the product functionality and
                                the stability of the product is proved.

                                Many times, the product is given an Alpha release. A small bunch of users use the
                                product and give their feedback. After analyzing the feedback, modifications are made to
                                the software and then released as a Beta release. Now, more users have access to the
                                software program.<br><br>


                                <h3> <b> 6. Maintenance and Updates</b></h3>

                                As described earlier, software development is a cycle. It is an iterative process of
                                software development. After launching the product, the process is not complete. You need
                                to keep a track of software maintenance and keep upgrading it. You need to consistently
                                monitor software development and suggest changes whenever required.

                                This is done because technology keeps advancing and in order to keep up with these
                                changes, the software products are needed to be updated. As time passes, users have
                                different requirements that are uncovered. Further, user feedback also plays an
                                important role in devising future updates for any software product.
