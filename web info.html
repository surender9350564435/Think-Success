            <h1>1. What is web development?</h1><br>

            <h6>Web development is the process of building websites and applications for the
                internet, or for<br> a private
                network known as an intranet. Web development is not concerned with the design of<br> a website; rather,
                it’s all about the coding and programming that powers the website’s <br>functionality.
                From the most simple, static web pages to social media platforms and apps, from e-commerce <br>websites
                to
                content management systems (CMS)—all the tools we use via the internet on a daily basis<br> have been
                built
                by developers.</h6><br><br>

            <h1 class="pt-5">Types of web development</h1><br>

            <h6 class="">Web development can be broken down into three layers: client-side coding (frontend),<br>
                server-side coding
                (backend) and database technology.

                Let’s take a look at each of these layers in more detail.<br><br>


                <h5>1. Client-side</h5>

                Client-side scripting, or frontend development, refers to everything that <br>the end user experiences
                directly. Client-side code executes in a web browser and directly relates to what<br> people see when
                they
                visit a website. Things like layout, fonts, colours, menus and contact forms are all<br> driven by the
                frontend.
                You can get a good taste of the work of a frontend developer by watching this video <br>tutorial, and
                taking
                for our free short course for beginners, in which you’ll build your <br>very first website from scratch.
            </h6><br><br>


            <h5>2.Server-side</h5>

            <p> Server-side scripting, or backend development, is all about what goes on <br>behind the scenes. The
                backend
                is essentially the part of a website that the user doesn’t actually see. It is</br> responsible for
                storing
                and organizing data, and ensuring that everything on the client-side runs smoothly.</br> It does this by
                communicating with the frontend.

                Whenever something happens on the client-side—say, a user fills out a form—the <br>browser sends a
                request
                to the server-side. The server-side “responds” with relevant information in the <br>form of frontend
                code
                that the browser can then interpret and display.

                <h5>3. Database technology</h5>

                Websites also rely on database technology. The database contains all the<br> files and content that are
                necessary for a website to function, storing it in such a way that makes <br>it easy to retrieve,
                organize,
                edit, and save. The database runs on a server, and most websites typically<br> use some form of
                relational
                database management system (RDBMS).

                To summarize: the frontend, backend, and database technology all work together<br> to build and run a
                fully
                functional website or application, and these three layers form<br> the foundation of web development.

            <h1>The difference between web development and web design.</h1><br><br>


            <p>  Just like with software engineering, you might also hear the terms “web development” and <br>“web design”
                used interchangeably, but these are two very different things.

                Imagine a web designer and web developer working together to build a car: the developer<br> would take care
                of all the functional components, like the engine, the wheels and the gears, while the designer would be
                responsible for both the visual aspects—how the car looks, the layout of the dashboard, <br>the design of
                the seats—and for the user experience provided by the car, so whether or not it’s a <br>smooth drive.

                Web designers design how the website looks and feels. They model the layout of the<br> website, making sure
                it’s logical, user-friendly and pleasant to use. They consider all the different visual <br>elements: what
                color schemes and fonts will be used? What buttons, drop-down menus and scrollbars <br>should be included,
                and where? Which interactive touchpoints does the user interact with to get from point <br>A to B? Web
                design also considers the information architecture of the website, establishing what<br> content will be
                included and where it should be placed.

                Web design is an extremely broad field, and will often be broken down into more specific <br>roles such as
                User Experience Design, User Interface Design, and Information Architecture.

                It is the web developer’s job to take this design and develop it into a live, fully<br> functional website.
                A frontend developer takes the visual design as provided by the web designer and<br> builds it using coding
                languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A backend developer builds<br> the more advanced functionality
                of the site, such as the checkout function on an e-commerce site.

                In short, a web designer is the architect, while the web<br> developer is the builder or engineer.</p>
